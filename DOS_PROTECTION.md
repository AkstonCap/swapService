# DoS Protection Implementation Summary

## Anti-DoS Protections Added

### 1. **Minimum Deposit Threshold** 
- **Config**: `MIN_DEPOSIT_USDC = "0.1"` (0.1 USDC minimum)
- **Converted**: `MIN_DEPOSIT_USDC_UNITS = 100000` (100k micro-units)
- **Logic**: Deposits below threshold treated as fee-only donations

### 2. **Micro-Deposit Fee Penalty**
- **Config**: `MICRO_DEPOSIT_FEE_PCT = 100` (100% fee for spam)
- **Effect**: Sub-threshold deposits lose entire amount to fees
- **Result**: Makes spam attacks unprofitable

### 3. **Batch Processing Limits**
- **Config**: `MAX_DEPOSITS_PER_LOOP = 100` 
- **Protection**: Limits processing per iteration
- **Benefit**: Prevents resource exhaustion from million+ deposits

### 4. **Enhanced Logging**
- **Added**: `USDC_MICRO_DEPOSIT` log events
- **Tracking**: Amount, net value, threshold, fee taken
- **Purpose**: Monitor and detect attack patterns

## Attack Mitigation Effectiveness

### **Before Protection:**
- 1M × 0.000001 USDC deposits = Service crash + fee drain
- Each micro-deposit consumed 1000× more in fees than deposited
- Unlimited processing could exhaust memory/CPU

### **After Protection:**
- Micro-deposits become revenue (100% fee capture)
- Processing limited to 100 deposits per loop
- Attack becomes self-defeating (costs attacker money)
- Service remains responsive to legitimate users

## Configuration Flexibility

```python
# Adjust thresholds as needed:
MIN_DEPOSIT_USDC = "0.05"          # Lower threshold
MICRO_DEPOSIT_FEE_PCT = "50"       # Partial fee instead of 100%
MAX_DEPOSITS_PER_LOOP = "200"      # Higher processing limit
```

## Economic Impact

**Legitimate Users**: Unaffected (normal deposits ≥ 0.1 USDC)
**Attackers**: Pay premium fees for failed spam attempts
**Service**: Gains revenue from spam while maintaining performance

The 0.1 USDC threshold effectively neutralizes micro-deposit DoS while maintaining service availability.
